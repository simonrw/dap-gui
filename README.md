# DAP GUI

[![test](https://github.com/simonrw/dap-gui/actions/workflows/test.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/simonrw/dap-gui/actions/workflows/test.yml)

Very early prototype of a general purpose GUI debugger based on the [DAP][dap] protocol and [egui]([url](https://github.com/emilk/egui)).

## Motivation

This repository exists because I do not like any of the debuggers I (currently) use day to day. I have tried:

* pycharm
* vs code
* neovim dap

They do not feel right to me.

My hope with this project is to create a general purpose GUI on top of the [DAP][dap] protocol that I like to use.

## Features

* fast
* stable
* TBD
